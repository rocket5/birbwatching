        <p><em>Birb Watching</em> follows the tenets of Cozy Games. Unlike traditional bird watching simulators, Birb Watching will not foster completionist instincts. It is a game that the user can win, but there is no lose state. Birb Watching is a peaceful and gentle experience, allowing for relaxation and a gradual understanding of the relationships that can develop between bird and player, bird and bird, and player and environment. </p>
